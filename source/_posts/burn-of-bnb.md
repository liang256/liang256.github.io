## About burn

### When

- burn as gas fee ([BEP-95](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/bep-95))
- burn by quarter
- burn by price ([Auto-Burn](###Auto-Burn))
- some smart contracts also burn BNB in some conditions

### Why

To make deflation

### How

Send tokens to an address without a private key, which means no one can access the tokens anymore.

## BEP-95

### Why

To fasten the burn efficiency.

### How

Since the solution is to burn partial of validatorsâ€™ reward, the more users use BSC (which means more blocks need to be validated by validators), the more BNB would be burned.

## Auto-Burn

### Rule

The more the price of BNB decreases, the more BNB will be burned.

When the total supply is lower than 1B, the burn process stops (BEP-95 still works).

### Formula


```
B = N * 1000 / (P + K)
```

- B: how many BNB to burn
- N: new BNB amount of this quarter
- P: average price
- K: constant value, 1000
