## essential 
essential of animstion is when and what -  at what frame happens what shape.
this applies to both 3d and 2d animation. or say, all kind of animation eventually project to viewer which is 2d (we can't see a thing's front and back in the same time)
animation a over 100 years technique and already well developed (no new tech).
thus, essential of animation simple, no secret, it's 3d, media, fancy words anogostic.

## 
with the essential

- a good skeleton animation can't geretee good animation result
- a rich motion libray can't geretee good animation result

- good timeing and spacing leads to good animation
- good shapes to viewer(camera in 3d production) leads to good animation
    - what is a good shape?
        - deliver clear and precise infomation


## users
i see different users
1. professional animator (not only 3d animator but all professional who master when and what)
2. whoever want to make animation but don't know when and what technique
    2.1 wamt to make animation but have no idea at all
    2.2 have clear images in mind but have no technique

same to help users create good animation, tools can be totally different for each targets.

### professional animatior
define
- knows timeing and spacing
- knows camera language
- have clear perfermance ideas in their mind, they knows what time and what shapes to put

tool can help them then should focus on
- faster implement their ideas in their mind
- faster construct shapes (to viewer/camera) at precise time

### non-professional but has clear idea
define
- has initial clips in their mind but maybe not the best practice (not best shape, layout, timing)

tool should focus on
- faster implement their ideas in their mind
- suggest better implementation based on their intension

### need an animation but have no idea at all
define
- i need an animation for my xxx but i have no idea at all

tool should focus on
- provide ideas
- easy to use (ik/fk controller, skeleton, timing and spacing, camera language, all professional concepts should be hidden or removed in the flow)
